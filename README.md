This is the code repository for [Data Forecasting and Segmentation Using Microsoft Excel](https://www.packtpub.com/product/data-forecasting-and-segmentation-using-microsoft-excel/9781803247731), published by Packt.

**Learn how to design and build cloud-based data transformation pipelines using AWS**

## What is this book about?

Data Forecasting and Segmentation Using Microsoft Excel guides you through basic statistics to test whether your data can be used to perform regression predictions and time series forecasts. The exercises covered in this book use real-life data from Kaggle, such as demand for seasonal air tickets and credit card fraud detection.

You’ll learn how to apply the grouping K-means algorithm, which helps you find segments of your data that are impossible to see with other analyses, such as business intelligence (BI) and pivot analysis. By analyzing groups returned by K-means, you’ll be able to detect outliers that could indicate possible fraud or a bad function in network packets.

By the end of this Microsoft Excel book, you’ll be able to use the classification algorithm to group data with different variables. You’ll also be able to train linear and time series models to perform predictions and forecasts based on past data.

This book covers the following exciting features: 
* Understand why machine learning is important for classifying data segmentation
* Focus on basic statistics tests for regression variable dependency
* Test time series autocorrelation to build a useful forecast
* Use Excel add-ins to run K-means without programming
* Analyze segment outliers for possible data anomalies and fraud
* Build, train, and validate multiple regression models and time series forecasts

## Instructions and Navigations
All of the code is organized into folders.

The code will look like the following:
```
le = LabelEncoder()
for i in bin _ cols:
    churn _ data[i] = le.fit _ transform(churn _ data[i])
```

## Get to Know the Author
**Fernando Roque** has 24 years of experience in working with statistics for quality control and financial risk assessment of projects after planning, budgeting, and execution. In his work, Fernando applies Python k-means and time series machine learning algorithms, using Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI) drone images to find crop regions with more resilience to droughts. He also applies time series and k-means algorithms for supply chain management (logistics) and inventory planning for seasonal demand.
